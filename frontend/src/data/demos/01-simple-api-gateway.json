  "explanation": {
    "overview": "This is the simplest Kong Gateway pattern. You're creating a gateway that forwards requests from clients to a backend service. Think of it like a smart router for your API.",

    "steps": [
      {
        "title": "Create a Service",
        "description": "A Service in Kong represents your backend API. In this example, we're using HTTPBin (a public testing service at httpbin.org). In production, this would be your actual backend like users-api.internal:8080.",
        "nodeId": "service-1",
        "tip": "Always use HTTPS for production services to ensure secure communication between Kong and your backend."
      },
      {
        "title": "Create a Route",
        "description": "A Route defines how clients access your service. This route matches any request to the path /api. When Kong receives a request to http://kong:8000/api, it knows to forward it to the HTTPBin service.",
        "nodeId": "route-1",
        "tip": "Routes can match on paths, methods, hosts, or headers. You can be very specific about what traffic gets routed where."
      },
      {
        "title": "Connect Route to Service",
        "description": "This connection tells Kong: 'When a request matches this route, forward it to this service.' This is the core of Kong's request routing.",
        "edgeId": "route-1-service-1",
        "tip": "Every Route MUST connect to exactly one Service. This is a strict Kong requirement."
      }
    ],

    "keyTakeaways": [
      "Routes define HOW clients access your APIs (matching rules)",
      "Services define WHERE requests should be forwarded (backend location)",
      "The Route → Service connection is mandatory and must be 1:1",
      "Kong acts as a smart proxy, forwarding matched requests to your backend"
    ]
  },

  "testInstructions": "After deploying this configuration:\n\n1. Send a test request:\n   curl http://localhost:8000/api/get\n\n2. You should receive a JSON response from HTTPBin showing your request details.\n\n3. Try different methods:\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/post\n\nIf you get a response, congratulations! Your first Kong Gateway is working.",

  "expectedOutput": "{\n  \"args\": {},\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\",\n    \"X-Forwarded-Host\": \"localhost\"\n  },\n  \"origin\": \"your-ip-address\",\n  \"url\": \"https://httpbin.org/get\"\n}",

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Not setting the service host",
      "fix": "Always specify a valid backend host (hostname or IP address)",
      "explanation": "Kong needs to know where to forward requests. Without a host, the service won't work."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to connect Route to Service",
      "fix": "Drag a connection from the Route node to the Service node",
      "explanation": "Routes must be connected to services. An unconnected route won't forward any traffic."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Using wrong path matching",
      "fix": "Set strip_path to false if you want to preserve the original path",
      "explanation": "If strip_path is true, Kong removes /api from the path before forwarding. Usually you want to keep it."
